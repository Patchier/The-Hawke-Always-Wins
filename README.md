# The Hawke Always Wins

February 27th, 2021 - Full Install: ~17GB.


## OVERVIEW

This ReadMe is designed to help you with the last few finishing steps necessary to enjoy The Hawke Always Wins as I personally enjoy it. 


## GOALS

-  Put the finishing touches on your The Hawke Always Wins installation

-  Get you playing the game as quickly as possible


## First off, you will need:

-   A clean, fresh, and LEGAL Steam installation of Dragon Age II (note: I am using this on Steam, and am unsure if this will work with Origin. It DOES require all of the DLC, so purchasing the Steam DLC package is likely required.)


## Install Dragon Age II

- This part is self-explanatory. You'll want to go to the installation of the game, and remove all files present in the install folder (For example, steamapps/common/Dragon Age II). 

- Once done, go ahead and re-install it. This ensures that any installs you have will be totally clean, which is important for the next steps. 

- While you're here, run the game once, and once in the main menu, configure the settings of the game however you so desire.


Install The Hawke Always Wins via Wabbajack
-----------------------------------------

1.  Simply open the Wabbajack UI, which can be acquired from here if you don't already have it: <https://www.wabbajack.org/#/>. 

2.  Once you've installed Wabbajack, or if you already have it, open it up and choose "Browse Modlists". 

3.  From there, you will download "The Hawke Always Wins" by clicking the little down arrow. 

4.  After that, you will choose an installation folder (I recommend something like "D:/The Hawke Always Wins", substituting D: for any drive available.) This CANNOT be where Wabbajack.exe is located, nor your Dragon Age II folder.

5.  Downloads will auto-populate for you, but you can change that location if you so choose. 

6.  From there, just click the "play" button and let it do the rest.


Copy over the Game Folder Files
------------------------------------------------

1. After the installation has completed, navigate to your The Hawke Always Wins installation folder

2. Open the folder labeled "Game Folder Files"

3. Inside of this folder will be a few files that need to be copied to the bin_ship folder, located in your Dragon Age II installation folder. Overwrite when prompted for the two LAA patched executables.


## Starting the game

Once these steps are complete, you will be ready to play. Simply launch the ModOrganizer.exe present in your The Hawke Always Wins installation folder, choose Dragon Age II from the dropdown in the top right, and launch the game from there.


## Mods to be aware of

- Better Combat DA2: Improves items, abilities, and difficulty to be a tad more balanced at all times.

- Arishok AI Rebalance: Exactly what it says on the tin. Rebalances the AI for the Arishok fight so it's a bit less painful.

- All Starting and Signature Weapons Improved: Improves starting equipment as well as making all in-game equipment improve with level-up.
